This project main goal is to produce a data-based ranking of the most positive / negative metal bands, based on sentiment analysis performed on their songs lyrics.

Song lyrics are automatically scrapped online based on a provided list of artists names.

Sentiment analysis is then iterated over each song in an artist's discography. Song scores are tallied to obtain a final artist score.
